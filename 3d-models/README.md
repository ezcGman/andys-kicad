# Andy's 3D Models
After doing my own footprints, I also wanted to have 3D modeld for them, to have the 3D rendered view of my PCBs look awesome :) I'll always include the `*.step` file to use in KiCad, as also the FreeCad file to edit it yourself.

## E-Byte-E32-xxxM20S
3D Model for the E-Byte E32-400M20S & E32-900M20S LoRa (SPI) module: https://www.ebyte.com/en/product-view-news.html?id=1613. Please bear with me, as this is my first ever 3D model I made in FreeCad. It also still has a known issue when raytracing the 3D view in KiCad: The text and logo seem to throw a lot of (weird) shadows... No idea why yet but happy for feedback / help here!

## E-Byte-E220-xxxT22S
TBD! SoonTM
